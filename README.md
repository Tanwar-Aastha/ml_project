## Problem Statement
To maintain transparency with their clients, food delivery services such as Zomato and Swiggy need to indicate the precise time it will take to deliver your order. Based on how long delivery partners have previously taken to deliver the same distance, these businesses employ machine learning algorithms to forecast when food will be delivered.

We must determine the distance between the location of food preparation and the location of food consumption in order to forecast the meal delivery time in real-time. Once the distance between the restaurant and the delivery locations has been determined, we must determine the correlations between the time it took delivery partners to deliver the food over the same distance in the past.
